"""Snapshot test for FEAT-006 socket DISPATCH stability (T091 / FR-022 / FR-023).

The dispatch table's KEY ORDER is part of the FEAT-002 stability rule
(insertion order preserved across feature versions). FEAT-001..005
established the first seven entries; FEAT-006 appends five more. This
test pins the exact ordered key list so an accidental re-ordering or
added entry is caught immediately.
