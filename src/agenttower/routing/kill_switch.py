"""FEAT-009 routing kill-switch service (FR-026 — FR-030).

Wraps :class:`agenttower.routing.dao.DaemonStateDao` with a
write-through cache for ``is_enabled()`` — the delivery worker calls
this on every loop iteration, so the read must not hit SQLite each time.

Toggle endpoints (``enable`` / ``disable``) are host-only (Clarifications
session 2 Q2 + research §R-005); the boundary check lives in
``socket_api/methods.py`` (T049). This module is origin-agnostic — it
accepts an operator identity string (either an ``agt_<12-hex>`` agent_id
or the ``host-operator`` sentinel) and trusts the dispatch layer to
have enforced the host-only constraint.

Idempotency is computed here: if a caller invokes ``enable()`` on a
flag that's already enabled, the returned :class:`ToggleResult` has
``changed=False`` and the audit-emission step (caller's responsibility)
MUST be skipped (contracts/socket-routing.md "Success response").
