# Implementation Plan: Local App Backend Contract for Desktop Control Panel

**Branch**: `011-app-backend-contract` | **Date**: 2026-05-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-app-backend-contract/spec.md`

## Summary

FEAT-011 turns `agenttowerd` into a stable **local-only application backend** for a future packaged desktop control panel. It introduces the `app.*` socket method namespace as a **host-only façade** over the existing newline-delimited JSON Unix socket. Every `app.*` method dispatches into the same daemon-internal service layer used by the existing CLI-facing methods — there is no parallel write path, no new SQLite table, no schema migration, and no new persisted state.

The work splits into **seven additive layers** under a new sub-package `src/agenttower/app_contract/`:

1. **App-session layer** — in-memory per-connection sessions (`app_session_token` uuid v4, monotonic `app_session_id`), invalidated on socket close. No persistence.
2. **Host-only peer gate** — reuses the FEAT-009 host-vs-container peer detection (already required for the routing-toggle host-only rule). Every `app.*` call rejects bench-container peers with the closed-set code `host_only`.
3. **Bootstrap surface** — `app.preflight` (no session required, diagnostic codes only) and `app.hello` (issues the session, returns daemon/schema/contract versions, capability_flags as `{}` at v1.0).
4. **Readiness + dashboard surface** — `app.readiness` (probes docker, tmux_discovery, sqlite, jsonl, routing_worker, log_attachment_workers + structured `hints[]`) and `app.dashboard` (counts + recents + `hints[]`). Both read-only, side-effect-free, no global lock.
5. **Read surfaces** — `app.<entity>.list` / `.detail` for `container`, `pane`, `agent`, `log_attachment`, `event`, `queue`, `route`. Pagination default 50 / cap 200 per FR-020a. Normative `state_priority` / `role_priority` integer mappings per FR-021a back the default orderings.
6. **Mutation surface** — `app.agent.register_from_pane` (adopt-mode façade over FEAT-006 `register-self`), `app.agent.update`, `app.log.attach/detach`, `app.send_input` (with optional `idempotency_key`, FR-031a), `app.queue.approve/delay/cancel`, `app.route.add/remove/update`, `app.scan.containers/panes/status` (with 30s wait cap, FR-030b, and last-100 in-memory retention, FR-030c). Last-write-wins on entity updates (FR-030a); `stale_object` reserved for queue terminal-state guards.
7. **Envelope + error layer** — uniform `{ok, app_contract_version, result}` / `{ok, app_contract_version, error: {code, message, details}}` shapes (FR-033). **27-entry** closed-set codes (FR-034 — bumped from 26 in Round-4 with `malformed_request`) with per-code `details` registry (FR-034a). `details` is always an object, even when `{}`. Wire-framing strictness (FR-003b): UTF-8 only, `\n`-terminated, no `\r`/`\x00`, no trailing content — violations are `malformed_request` before dispatch.

The contract is versioned `MAJOR.MINOR = "1.0"`. Within a major, only additive changes; clients ignore unknown fields, daemons ignore unknown request fields. A major mismatch returns `app_contract_major_unsupported` from `app.hello` with both versions in `details`; no session is issued. `capability_flags = {}` at v1.0 (every FEAT-011 method is required and inferred from version support).

The CLI surface (FEAT-002..FEAT-010 methods) is preserved bit-identically. Bench-container thin clients continue to use the legacy namespace; the `app.*` namespace is host-only.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (matches existing daemon).
**Primary Dependencies**: existing daemon services from FEAT-002 (socket dispatcher), FEAT-003 (container discovery), FEAT-004 (pane discovery), FEAT-006 (agent registration), FEAT-007 (log attachment), FEAT-008 (event pipeline), FEAT-009 (message queue + permission gate), FEAT-010 (routes catalog). No new third-party Python dependencies are introduced.
**Storage**: In-memory only. No SQLite migration. No JSONL schema bump (the JSONL audit format adds an `origin = "app"` value to its existing `origin` field, which already accommodates string variants — Round-4 Block G Q51). Audit event names reuse the **upstream FEAT names byte-for-byte** (e.g., `queue_approved`, `route_created`, `agent_registered` — Round-4 Block G Q44). Audit writer is serialized by a **process-wide mutex** (FR-044a); audit is **best-effort** — on JSONL outage, mutation still commits and the row is dropped with a stderr warning (FR-044b). Audit row is written **after** SQLite commit and **before** response envelope (FR-044c). Three in-memory stores added: app-session table (cap **8** concurrent sessions per FR-008b), scan-result table (cap 100 per daemon process), per-session idempotency-key dedupe map. In-flight scans cap at **4** across all sessions with same-kind coalescing (FR-030d/e).
**Testing**: pytest. The target test layout has contract tests under `tests/contract/test_app_*.py` using synthetic Unix-socket clients (no `agenttower` subprocess invocation — see SC-001) and integration tests under `tests/integration/test_story*.py`. The current PR ships a smoke-style equivalent at `tests/unit/test_app_contract_smoke.py` covering the same FRs/SCs at the function-call level; migrating the assertions into the structured `tests/contract/` + `tests/integration/` layout is tracked as tasks T019..T023 and is part of the US1 polish slice. Existing FEAT-002..010 test suite remains untouched.
**Target Platform**: Linux primary; macOS and Windows host targets follow per Assumptions. The daemon is Python; the packaged client is out of scope (FEAT-012). All FEAT-011 work is server-side.
**Project Type**: CLI daemon + structured-API façade. Single Python package (`agenttower`).
**Performance Goals**: SC-002 cold-start-to-dashboard ≤ 500 ms (no-cache, ≥1 container, ≥1 agent fixture); SC-004 adopt round-trip ≤ 2 s; `app.preflight` and `app.hello` < 50 ms (target); `app.readiness` < 100 ms; list/detail < 100 ms at default pagination.
**Constraints**: Local-only — FR-003 forbids any non-Unix-socket listener; SC-006 verifies via packet capture. Host-only `app.*` — FR-042 rejects bench-container peers with `host_only`. Pagination cap 200 (FR-020a). Synchronous scan wait cap 30 s (FR-030b). Concurrency caps: **8 app sessions process-wide** (FR-008b), **4 in-flight scans** (FR-030e), same-kind scan **coalescing** enabled (FR-030d). Per-session idempotency-key store is in-memory only; lost on daemon restart or session close (FR-031a). Per-line payload caps **1 MiB request / 8 MiB response** (FR-003a) — request overflow returns `payload_too_large`; response overflow is a daemon-side invariant guarded by the FR-020a pagination cap. Wire-framing strictness (FR-003b): `\n`-terminated UTF-8, no `\r`/`\x00`, no trailing content — violations are `malformed_request` before dispatch. No new persisted secret (FR-043).
**Scale/Scope**: Single-host, single-user. Typical workstation has ≤10 bench containers, ≤200 agents across them, ≤1k events / day, ≤100 routes, a handful of concurrent app sessions (1–3, capped at 8 by FR-008b). Pagination tuned for "screenful" UI rendering (default 50). Scan results retained for the last 100 scans per daemon process. SC tests use exactly these fixture sizes (Round-4 Block H Q54); higher-scale tests are a separate suite.

## Constitution Check

*Gate: must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **I. Local-First Host Control** | ✅ PASS | FR-003 forbids network listeners; FR-040/042 preserve socket-permission model and add a host-only restriction on the `app.*` namespace. No durable state outside the existing FEAT-001..010 SQLite/JSONL. |
| **II. Container-First MVP** | ✅ PASS (with note) | FEAT-011 is post-MVP per the brief; it still targets bench containers (the adopt-mode workflow exists to promote tmux panes inside containers). No host-only-tmux or Antigravity work is introduced. |
| **III. Safe Terminal Input** | ✅ PASS | `app.send_input` rides the FEAT-009 queue (FR-031), respects the permission gate and global routing kill switch. Per-message `idempotency_key` (FR-031a) prevents accidental double-delivery; it is not a security boundary. |
| **IV. Observable and Scriptable** | ✅ PASS | Legacy CLI methods unchanged (FR-002); SC-001 asserts the app never log-scrapes. `origin = "app"` + `app_session_id` flow to JSONL audit (FR-009, FR-044, SC-008). `app_session_token` never appears in JSONL (SC-008). |
| **V. Conservative Automation** | ✅ PASS | No workflow decisions added. The façade exposes the same actions a human operator can take from the CLI; no auto-routing, auto-master-promotion, or auto-classification is introduced. |

**Post-design re-check** (after Phase 1 below): unchanged — all gates remain green. No complexity-tracking entries required.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single-package extension. The existing `src/agenttower/` package gains one new sub-package (`app_contract/`). No existing module changes shape; the only existing-module touch is FEAT-002's socket dispatcher registering the new `app.*` handlers via `dispatcher.py`'s `register()` entry point. This preserves SC-006 (no other I/O surface), FR-002 (legacy methods unchanged), and FR-004 (app.* dispatches into the same service layer the CLI uses — concretely, `mutations.py` calls `src/agenttower/agents/service.py`, `src/agenttower/routing/service.py`, `src/agenttower/queue/service.py`, etc. directly).
